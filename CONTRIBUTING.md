## How to Contribute

In the spirit of open source software, **everyone** is encouraged to help
improve this project.

### Ways *you* can contribute:

* by installing and testing the software
* by reporting bugs
* by suggesting new features
* by suggesting labels for our issues
* by writing or editing documentation
* by writing test specifications
* by writing code (**no patch is too small**: fix typos, add comments, clean up
  inconsistent whitespace)
* by refactoring code
* by closing [issues][issue_tracker]
* by reviewing patches

### Reporting a bug or other issue

We use the [GitHub issue tracker][issue_tracker] to track bugs and feature
requests. To submit a bug report or feature request:

1. [Browse][issue_tracker] or [search][issue_search] our issues to make sure
it hasn't already been submitted.

2. When submitting a bug report, it's helpful to include any details that may
be necessary to reproduce the bug, including:

    - a screenshot
    - your operating system (Windows 7, Mac OSX 10.9.2, etc.)
    - your web browser and version (Internet Explorer 9, Chrome 27, etc.)
    - a stack trace of any errors encountered
    - your Java version
    - your Clojure and Leiningen version

For developers, a bug report should ideally include a pull request with
failing specs.

### Updating the Code? Open a Pull Request

To submit a code change to the project for review by the team:

1. **Setup:** [Install the app][install] on your computer.

2. **Branch:** [Create a topic branch][branch] for the one specific issue
you're addressing (if you are really committed to support us to fix the issue,
you can create any initial dummy code and create a pull request for this, so
we can see what's coming and avoid duplicated works).

3. **Implement:** Implement your feature or bug fix - don't forget to write tests and check that 
all the tests are passing (the news and also the old ones).

4. **Commit changes:** Add, commit, and push your changes.

5. **Pull request:** [Submit a pull request][pr] to send your changes to this
repository for review.
